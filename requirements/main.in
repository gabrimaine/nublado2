# Editable runtime dependencies (equivalent to install_requires)
# Add direct runtime dependencies here, as well as implicit dependencies
# with constrained versions.
#
# After editing, update requirements/main.txt by running:
#     make update-deps
#
# JupyterHub and its direct dependencies are intentionally not included in
# the requirements because we want to use the versions that come with the
# Docker image that we use as a base.  However, the plugins that we use
# are included, since those are not preinstalled in the Docker image.
