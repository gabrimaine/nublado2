# Add an explicit dependency on importlib-resources to generate hashes when
# the requirements file is rebuilt on Python 3.9.  It's not required for
# Python 3.9, but is for Python 3.7, and without this dependency,
# installation will fail on Python 3.7.  This is a transitive dependency
# from jupyterhub -> alembic.
