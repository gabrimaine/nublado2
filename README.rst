Nublado 2
#########

Nublado is the Vera C. Rubin Observatory instantiation of JupyterHub in Kubernetes, with some customizations for the needs of the project.
This package holds the Python add-ons and supporting infrastructure used to add those customizations.

This is the second iteration of our JupyterHub customizations.
It replaces `rubin-jupyter-hub <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/rubin-jupyter-hub>`__, `rubin-jupyter-config <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/rubin-jupyter-config>`__, and `nublado <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nublado>`__.
